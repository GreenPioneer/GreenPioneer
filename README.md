## I help coding bootcamp students land their first high-paying job as a professional software developer.

### Hey Junior Engineers:

Are you frustrated with applying for job after jobâ€”and never hearing back from any of them?

Or maybe you're intimidated by technical interviews and dreading the idea of solving coding puzzles on a whiteboard?

Do you want to finally break through and land your first job as a professional software developer?

If so, Coding Career Fastlane can help.

In the last 5 years I've coached hundreds of bootcamp students and new software developers to fill in gaps in their technical knowledge, stand out from the crowd when applying for jobs, and confidently demonstrate their skills in their technical interview.

That's why I created Coding Career Fastlane... a coaching community where software developers get personalized, individualized feedback and a proven approach to getting hired as a developer.

When I became a senior software developer, I quickly discovered that my true passion is seeing other developers grow and improve their skills.

So several years ago I started mentoring other new developers through one of the most popular online bootcamps.

What I quickly realized is that my students were getting an excellent technical backgroundâ€”yet they often struggled to get noticed by employers after they graduated. And when they were lucky enough to get an interview, their lack of confidence in their new skills came through loud and clearâ€”and they got rejected.

To help my students overcome these challenges, I started working on a set of simple tools to aid their job search. And as my students put these ideas to work, they started getting hired.

The other coaches soon noticed my success as a "fixer" and started sending me their toughest cases.

I've now mentored 1000+ new software developers. My students have landed interviews and offers at companies including Google, Intel, Apple, Lyft, Twilio, Fidelity, IBM, 3M, BBVA Bank, and GE.

I started Coding Career Fastlane as a way to reach more new developers with this proven set of principles and tools.
