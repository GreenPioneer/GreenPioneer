When you paid 20 grand to go to coding bootcamp, did you think it’d be this hard to get a job?

Has anything like this happened to you recently?

🤯 You applied to a job and got rejected before talking to anyone at the company.
🧐 You get nervous about technical interviews.
😞 You tried revamping your resume a few times, but it’s still not working.

You’re not alone.

Most bootcamp grads feel this way… and if you’ve been in the job hunt for a while it takes most bootcampers more than 6 months to land anything (even contracting gigs).

If you’re wondering about what you need to do to get hired, then you’re in the right place.

I’m Jason, and I help bootcampers get the jobs they want.

I spent the last 5 years coaching over 1,000 students at Thinkful and other bootcamps. I know exactly what employers are looking for in junior engineers. And if you’re feeling stuck, I can help you, too.

Job hunting in a pandemic is tough… and it’s annoying hearing your bootcamp career coach trying to tell you that “you’re just not networking enough”.

Imagine this situation:

🥳 No more nights on Leetcode, because you have someone telling you EXACTLY what to focus on.
🥰 Recruiters messaging YOU on LinkedIn asking you if you’re interested in jobs.
🤑 Looking at your bank account and seeing cash deposited now that you’re getting paid as a real software engineer.

I’m here to help you.

Are you ready to finally be a software engineer?
